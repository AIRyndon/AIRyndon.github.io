      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I started researching on a UWP application for a client of mine. This desktop app is supposed to save timesheets of current employees, and it lets them sign in and sign out of the workplace. The main purpose of this application is to save some paper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around last week, I started learning &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/index&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;UWP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-overview-wpf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;XAML.&lt;/a&gt; After watching some video series to get an idea about both, these were the first impressions I got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;xaml-is-easier-to-get-into-for-those-with-designer-backgrounds&#34;&gt;XAML is easier to get into for those with designer backgrounds&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the web world, what XAML is fully capable of is when you use the trio of HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. Of course you have to know C# for those other use cases in your application. However, I can confirm that from a designer point of view, you can go a long way into making something without typing code or markup â€“ I still consider myself a bad designer by the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
