      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the end of my &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;remote work with other developers&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Most of my worries at the beginning of this actually came true! In our defense though, we still managed to finish our &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;MVP&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Our project needs UI and UX updates, and Iâ€™ll work on it again sometime in the future. All in all, I am happy with how it turned out. Iâ€™m going to write down what I believe were my biggest weaknesses during the project, while it is still fresh in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I forgot where I learned about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Chingu&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, what I love about it though is the opportunity to be working remotely with other developers. We are on our first week in a 6-week team project and Iâ€™m both anxious and excited about this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;prerequisite task&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to enter the team project on the last day â€“ because its almost finals week in school. That experience was thrilling and scary. I want to note down what I think are our biggest roadblocks, so we can improve during the next weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post details my first impressions of &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;WordPress&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Umbraco.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; I recently learned how to use Umbraco in &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;one&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; of my projects, I also played around with WordPress in this blog(only as a power user though at the moment). Now letâ€™s take a look at what I believe are the pros and cons of each.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coding Bootcamp, should I have attended one?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From its name alone, a coding bootcamp tells you its intense. After attending &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;one&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; here in New Zealand, Iâ€™ll list what I think were the major pros and cons for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;PROS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;more-on-self-studying&#34;&gt;More on self studying&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was exposed to a DIY environment â€“ well even the New Zealand work environment is a lot like this. You only ask questions when you get completely stuck. There is little to no hand holding involved. For some this could be a con, but for me it is a pro. Perhaps because I actually like studying and poking around stuff ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;</description>
