        <p>I forgot where I learned about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Chingu (opens in a new tab)" href="https://chingu.io/" target="_blank">Chingu</a>, what I love about it though is the opportunity to be working remotely with other developers. We are on our first week in a 6-week team project and I&#8217;m both anxious and excited about this opportunity.</p>

<p>I finished the <a href="https://angeloryndon.com/portfolio/connect-four/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="prerequisite task (opens in a new tab)">prerequisite task</a> to enter the team project on the last day &#8211; because its almost finals week in school. That experience was thrilling and scary. I want to note down what I think are our biggest roadblocks, so we can improve during the next weeks.</p>

<h2 id="clearly-written-tasks">Clearly written tasks</h2>

<p>I think most if not all developers know that clearly written tasks is key to a successful project. The problem for me is I haven&#8217;t worked remotely with anyone before, and I rarely write down a clear to-do-list. I hope some of my team members love doing this, as I will suck at it. However, I have to step up because this is a crucial skill, even my current university instructor keeps telling me to WRITE-THINGS-DOWN.</p>

<h2 id="the-git-workflow">The Git workflow</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m fairly comfortable with Git when I&#8217;m alone, not so much when working remotely with other developers though. I read about some Git workflows before writing this, and I hope we don&#8217;t get stuck with sticky problems related to Git.</p>

<h2 id="differences-in-character-traits">Differences in character traits</h2>

<p>I hope this does not become a major issue, I consider myself chill so I hope it won&#8217;t be. Maybe I&#8217;m just overthinking things again, maybe our team project will run smoothly. Bottom-line is, I can&#8217;t wait to finish this strong.</p>
