        <p>I was learning ES6 about <a href="https://angeloryndon.com/learn-javascript-again/">two weeks ago</a>, and it reminded me of how modular programming in JavaScript was done during the years prior. I&#8217;m quite happy with how JavaScript has evolved, I would even say that I&#8217;m starting to like it. Before we go into the &#8220;How to do modular programming in JavaScript today&#8221;, I would like to give my thoughts on modular programming first.</p>

<h2 id="modular-programming">Modular Programming</h2>

<p>Modular programming is about chopping down a <em>big idea</em> (which is the program itself) into <em>little ideas</em> (the program&#8217;s features). You then build each of those <em>little ideas</em> and connect them together to create the <em>big idea</em>. This programming style allows you to create software that is easier to maintain &#8211; I&#8217;m in the opinion though that if you overdo it, your software will be even harder to understand and maintain.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-modular-programming-done-in-javascript">How is modular programming done in JavaScript</h2>

<p>When I first learned C#, modular programming was something I felt closer to &#8211; <em>I want to make small methods, and small classes.</em> Separating your code into smaller classes is built-into C#, and this was not the same with JavaScript. When I first learned JavaScript, there was a weird hack to separate your code into its own modules. You have to use a function that is invoked right after its creation &#8211; the term <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="IFFE (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE" target="_blank">IFFE</a> was coined for this behavior.</p>

<p>The addition of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="import (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import" target="_blank">import</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="export (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export" target="_blank">export</a> statements in ES6 means modular programming is now supported natively in JavaScript &#8211; <em>I don&#8217;t have experience with Node.js so I have no clue if ES6 imports and exports also work out-of-the-box there like in current Web Development</em>.</p>

<p>Below is an extremely quick rundown of how modular programming evolved in native JavaScript:</p>

<ol>
<li>A smart developer thought about IFFE, and the Module Pattern was born in JavaScript</li>
<li>CommonJS and other libraries made improvements to IFFE, and solved the problems with using it to create modules &#8211; <em>like script files should be loaded in order correctly, and some other problems</em></li>
<li>ES6 adopted the improvements from CommonJS et al, made some tweaks to it, and now we have module support in native JavaScript</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there are tons of resources around the web if you want to know more details about how modules evolved in JavaScript, and how to do it, so I won&#8217;t include it in this post.</p>
